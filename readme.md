# Testing Storybook with django-like template code

In view to looking at setting up a UI development environment that is BE independent here is a proof of concept on parsing django template tags in a Storybook HTML config.

I will add more detailed notes in due course but in the mean time give me a message on slack if you want to know more.

To test:

`npm install`

`npm run storybook`
